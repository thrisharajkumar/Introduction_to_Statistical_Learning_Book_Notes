# ðŸ“— An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
Python-focused translation of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning* (by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani).  
Every R-based example is recreated in Python using scikit-learn and pandas.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Reimplement ISL labs and examples using Python.  
- Grasp regression, classification, and resampling methods deeply.  
- Build conceptual understanding alongside practical skills.  
- Bridge traditional statistical learning with applied ML.
